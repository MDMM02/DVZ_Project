#Annual Traffic Injury Database (2005-2021)
**Overview**
This repository contains annual datasets of injury traffic accidents in France from 2005 to 2021. These datasets are derived from the "Bulletin of Analysis of Injury Traffic Accidents" (Fichier BAAC) compiled by law enforcement agencies. The information includes accident details, locations, vehicles involved, and victim information.

**Dataset Structure**
Each year's dataset is divided into four CSV files:

Characteristics
Locations
Vehicles
Users
Please note that certain user and vehicle-specific data have been redacted to protect privacy, as advised by CADA (January 2, 2012).

**Important Notes**
Data on hospitalized injuries is not comparable to previous years from 2018 onwards due to changes in data entry procedures.
The "hospitalized injury" indicator is no longer endorsed by the public statistics authority since 2019.

**Data Analysis**
To conduct meaningful analyses, it's crucial to understand road safety definitions and review the structure of the BAAC document and its coding guide.
